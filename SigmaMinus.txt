Description: 

The Sigma baryons are a family of 
subatomic hadron particles which have
two quarks from the first flavour 
generation (up and/or down quarks),
and a third quark from 
higher flavour generations.

The mean lifetime of a Sigma 
(negative) particle is roughly 
1.5 x 10^-10 s.
