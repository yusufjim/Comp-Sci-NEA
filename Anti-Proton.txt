Date of Discovery: 1955

Description: The antiproton, is the 
antiparticle of the proton. 
Antiprotons are stable, but they are 
typically short-lived, since any 
collision with a proton will cause 
both particles to be annihilated 
in a burst of energy. 

The existence of the antiproton with
-1 electric charge, was predicted by
Paul Dirac in 1933.
