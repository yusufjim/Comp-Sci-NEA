Description: A kaon is any of a group 
of four mesons distinguished by a 
quantum number called strangeness. 
In the quark model they are 
understood to be bound states of a 
strange quark (or antiquark) and 
an up or down antiquark (or quark).

Kaons have proved to be a copious 
source of information on the nature 
of fundamental interactions since their 
discovery in cosmic rays in 1947. 
They were essential in establishing 
the foundations of the Standard Model
of particle physics
