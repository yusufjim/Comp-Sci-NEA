Description: The neutron is a subatomic
particle, with no net electric charge
and a mass slightly larger than that
of a proton. 

The chemical and nuclear properties 
of the nucleus are determined 
by the no. of neutrons and protons.

The neutron is essential to the 
production of nuclear power.
Free neutrons, while not directly 
ionizing atoms, cause ionizing 
radiation.
