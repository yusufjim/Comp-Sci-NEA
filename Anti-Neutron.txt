Description: The antineutron is the 
antiparticle of the neutron. 
It differs from the neutron only in 
that some of its properties 
have equal magnitude but opposite sign. 

It has the same mass as the neutron, 
and no net electric charge, but has 
opposite baryon number (+1 for neutron,
-1 for the antineutron). This is 
because the antineutron is composed 
of antiquarks, while neutrons are 
composed of quarks.
