Description: A neutral pion is part of
a the pion family which are the lightest
of mesons (and thus the lightest hadrons).
This particle decays in 8.4×10-17 seconds 
into gamma rays.

Pions are not produced in radioactive
decay, but are commonly produced 
in high energy accelerators in 
collisions between hadrons. All types
of pions are also produced in natural
processes when high energy cosmic ray
protons and other hadronic cosmic ray
components interact with matter in 
the Earth's atmosphere.
